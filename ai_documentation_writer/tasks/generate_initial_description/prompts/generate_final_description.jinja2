Do not include obvious and trivial information, you are writing this document for highly technical audience with 10+ years of experience in software development.

# Output Constraints

Use plain english and markdown formatting limited to:
- Headers starting from ## (no top-level #), so you can use ##, ###, #### headers
- Any types of lists with sublists, enumerated or bullet points
