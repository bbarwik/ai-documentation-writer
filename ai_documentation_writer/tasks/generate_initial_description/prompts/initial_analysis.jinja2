# Project Analysis Initialization

You are analyzing a software project to create comprehensive documentation.

# Project Structure

Here is the complete file tree of the project:

{{ file_tree }}

Total files: {{ total_files }}
Total size: {{ total_size | filesizeformat }}

# Your Task

You will iteratively explore this codebase to understand its purpose, architecture, and functionality. In each iteration, you can select files to read and analyze. After multiple iterations, you'll generate a comprehensive initial description.

# Process

1. You can request to read up to {{ batch_max_files }} files per iteration
2. The total combined size of selected files must not exceed {{ batch_max_chars }} characters
3. You have up to 5 iterations to explore the codebase
4. When you have enough information, return an empty file list to proceed to documentation generation

Start by examining key files that will help you understand the project's purpose and structure (e.g., README, package.json, pyproject.toml, main entry points).
