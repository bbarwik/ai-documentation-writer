5. Any notable features or capabilities

Focus on understanding how these files contribute to the overall project structure and purpose.

Write in a professional, very detailed technical style suitable for highly experienced developers and technical stakeholders.
Do not include basic information about the project, like "This is a project about..." or "This is a project that...".
Do not include obvious and trivial information, you are writing this document for highly technical audience with 10+ years of experience in software development.

Use plain english and markdown formatting limited to:
- headers, but without top level header (#), so you can use ##, ###, #### headers.
- any types of lists with sublists, enumerated or bullet points.
- code blocks, but without any graphical representations, just code snippets.
- bold and italic text.
- inline code snippets.
Do not include any other text than the analysis of the project.
